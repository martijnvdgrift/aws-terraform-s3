# aws-terraform-s3

This module builds a s3 bucket with varying options.  
It will not do s3 origin, which is in another module.

## Basic Usage

```
module "s3" {
  source = "git@github.com:rackspace-infrastructure-automation/aws-terraform-s3//?ref=v0.0.5"
  bucket_name = "${random_string.s3_rstring.result}-example-s3-bucket"
  bucket_acl = "bucket-owner-full-control"
  bucket_logging = false
  bucket_tags = {
    RightSaid = "Fred"
    LeftSaid  = "George"
  }
  environment = "Development"
  lifecycle_enabled = true
  noncurrent_version_expiration_days = "425"
  noncurrent_version_transition_glacier_days = "60"
  noncurrent_version_transition_ia_days = "30"
  object_expiration_days = "425"
  transition_to_glacier_days = "60"
  transition_to_ia_days = "30"
  versioning = true
  website = true
  website_error = "error.html"
  website_index = "index.html"
}
```

| allowed\_origins | (Required) Specifies which origins are allowed. | `list` | `[]` | no |
| bucket\_acl | Bucket ACL. Must be either authenticated-read, aws-exec-read, bucket-owner-read, bucket-owner-full-control, log-delivery-write, private, public-read or public-read-write. For more details https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl | `string` | `"bucket-owner-full-control"` | no |
| bucket\_logging | Enable bucket logging. Will store logs in another existing bucket. You must give the log-delivery group WRITE and READ\_ACP permissions to the target bucket. i.e. true \| false | `string` | `false` | no |
| bucket\_name | The name of the S3 bucket for the access logs. The bucket name can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, periods (.), and dashes (-). Must be globally unique. If changed, forces a new resource. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| bucket\_tags | A map of tags to be applied to the Bucket. i.e {Environment='Development'} | `map` | `{}` | no |
| environment | Application environment for which this network is being created. must be one of ['Development', 'Integration', 'PreProduction', 'Production', 'QA', 'Staging', 'Test'] | `string` | `"Development"` | no |
| expose\_headers | Specifies expose header in the response. | `list` | `[]` | no |
| force\_destroy\_bucket | A boolean that indicates all objects should be deleted from the bucket so that the bucket can be destroyed without error. These objects are not recoverable. | `string` | `false` | no |
| kms\_master\_key\_id | The AWS KMS master key ID used for the SSE-KMS encryption. This can only be used when you set the value of sse\_algorithm as aws:kms. | `string` | `""` | no |
| lifecycle\_enabled | Enable object lifecycle management. i.e. true \| false | `string` | `false` | no |
| lifecycle\_rule\_prefix | Object keyname prefix identifying one or more objects to which the rule applies. Set as an empty string to target the whole bucket. | `string` | `""` | no |

| logging\_bucket\_prefix | Prefix for all log object keys. i.e. logs/ | `string` | `""` | no |
| max\_age\_seconds | Specifies time in seconds that browser can cache the response for a preflight request. | `string` | `"600"` | no |
| noncurrent\_version\_expiration\_days | Indicates after how many days we are deleting previous version of objects.  Set to 0 to disable or at least 365 days longer than noncurrent\_version\_transition\_glacier\_days. i.e. 0 to disable, 1-999 otherwise | `string` | `0` | no |
| noncurrent\_version\_transition\_glacier\_days | Indicates after how many days we are moving previous versions to Glacier.  Should be 0 to disable or at least 30 days longer than noncurrent\_version\_transition\_ia\_days. i.e. 0 to disable, 1-999 otherwise | `string` | `0` | no |
| noncurrent\_version\_transition\_ia\_days | Indicates after how many days we are moving previous version objects to Standard-IA storage. Set to 0 to disable. | `string` | `0` | no |
| object\_expiration\_days | Indicates after how many days we are deleting current version of objects. Set to 0 to disable or at least 365 days longer than TransitionInDaysGlacier. i.e. 0 to disable, otherwise 1-999 | `string` | `0` | no |
| prevent\_s3\_destroy | Enable this option so that terraform destroy command will not be able to destroy the S3 buckets | `bool` | `true` | no |
